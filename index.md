I'm a PhD student in the School of Informatic Department of [City University London](http://www.city.ac.uk). I advised by [George Spanoudakis](http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~gespan/). My research subject is network security special for [Botnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet). My Bachelor and Master graduated from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics [NUAA](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn) which focus on the distributed computating. The first programe language is C++, but now I should use many tools in my research, such as Java, Python, even DOS batch. I'm a co-founder of [IDAOYOO](http://www.idaoyoo.com) which is a Chinese tour guide social network based in London.
